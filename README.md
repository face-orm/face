**The library is currently under active development**


Why an other ORM?
-----------------

For years I have been working with no ORM and I can say I hate ORM because they are heavy, longer to learn, slower...
but i love them because it makes your development much more easy and reliable.

Face is per query oriented. That means it's more like an advanced **query builder**. I wanted something clear an transparent
that looks like **SQL**. But face is not only an SQL builder. In the last years a lot of **NoSQL databases** have been released.
Building a hybrid environment **mixing SQL and noSQL** is more and more common for a lot of reasons. Face place some
effort to create a **simple workflow** that can mix many databases with **performances in mind**
