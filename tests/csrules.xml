       Here we change two messages from the same sniff. Note how the
       codes are slightly different because the sniff developer has
       defined both a MaxExceeded message and a TooLong message. In the
       case of this sniff, one is used for warnings and one is used
       for errors.
    -->
    <rule ref="Generic.Files.LineLength.MaxExceeded">
        <message>Line contains %s chars, which is longer than the max limit of %s</message>
    </rule>
    <rule ref="Generic.Files.LineLength.TooLong">
        <message>Line longer than %s characters; contains %s characters</message>

    <!--
       Some sniffs have public member vars that allow you to
       customise specific elements of the sniff. In the case of
       the Generic LineLength sniff, you can customise the limit
       at which the sniff will throw warnings and the limit at
       which it will throw errors.

       The rule below includes the LineLength sniff but changes the
       settings so the sniff will show warnings for any line longer
       than 90 chars and errors for any line longer than 100 chars.
    -->
    <rule ref="Generic.Files.LineLength">
        <properties>

            <property name="absoluteLineLimit" value="100"/>
        </properties>
    </rule>

    <!--
       Another useful example of changing sniff settings is
       to specify the end of line character that your standard
       should check for.
